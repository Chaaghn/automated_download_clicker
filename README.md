# Automated download clicker
Combining virtual mouse clicker with multiple ENA dataset downloads

I want to use python's virtual mouse-clicker package to programmatically download multiple datasets from EMBL-EBI's ENA website. 
The script named 'extractor.py' will be the initiator which must be run to do this.

The script will use:

-python version: 2.7

-python packages: bs4, requests,selenium

-XML file generated after launching a specific ENA query

-getlinks.py and getloads.py, both in the same directory as extractort.py
